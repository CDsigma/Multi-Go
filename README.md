# Multi-Go

## Background And Overview

Multi-Go is inspired by the classical board game Go which is a turn based game on a square grid. 
The game is a divide and conquer game where the winner is decided by who has the most territory on the board. 
Classicly its a two player game but we are implementing a three player version.
